# Docs index for automation/agents

Use these documents as the single source of truth for deployment and operations:

- Platform standards: `docs/k8s-standards.md`
- Fleet environment labels: `docs/fleet-environment-labels.md`
- Root deployment system: `ROOT_DEPLOYMENT_SYSTEM.md`
- First principles: `FIRST_PRINCIPLES.md`
- Version policy (all solutions): `docs/solution-version-policy.md`
- Migration template (per solution): `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE.md`
- Migration principles: `MIGRATE.md`
- VPN/Tailscale: `VPN.md`

Notes:
- Keep docs centralized under `docs/` where possible; root files above are historical and will be migrated.
- Avoid duplicating content; link to shared docs from per-solution READMEs.
