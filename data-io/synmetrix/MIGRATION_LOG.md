# Synmetrix Kubernetes Migration Log

## Overview
This document chronicles the comprehensive migration and troubleshooting process for deploying Synmetrix on Kubernetes. The deployment involved converting from Docker Compose to a production-ready Kubernetes setup with proper microservices architecture.

## üîê **Authentication & Security Issues**

### JWT Secret Length Validation
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: Hasura failing with "Key size too small; should be atleast 32 characters"
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: JWT key was only 26 characters, Hasura requires 32+ character keys for security
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Generated proper 32+ character JWT secret using `openssl rand -hex 32`

### Admin Secret Consistency
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: Services returning 401 "invalid x-hasura-admin-secret" errors  
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: Different services using mismatched admin secret values during rolling updates
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Ensured all services use the same `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` value from centralized secrets

### Placeholder Values in Production
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: Services failing with authentication using "REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_SECRET" placeholder values
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: Secrets file contained placeholder text instead of actual secret values
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Updated all placeholder values with proper secret strings in `synmetrix-secrets.env`

### CubeJS API Secret Missing
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: CubeJS failing with "apiSecret is required option(s)" error
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: `CUBEJS_SECRET` environment variable not configured in Kubernetes deployment
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Added `CUBEJS_SECRET` to staging secrets file and verified kustomize configuration

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database & Schema Issues**

### PostgreSQL Connection Configuration
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: Hasura connection failures with "SSL required" and authentication errors
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: Missing SSL parameters in DATABASE_URL and using PgBouncer vs direct connection
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: 
  - Updated `DATABASE_URL` to include `?sslmode=prefer` parameter
  - Switched from PgBouncer to direct PostgreSQL connection (`cxs-pg-primary.data.svc`)

### Missing GraphQL Schema Exposure
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: CubeJS failing with "field 'datasources' not found in type: 'query_root'"
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: Database tables existed but Hasura hadn't tracked them for GraphQL API exposure
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Manually tracked tables through Hasura console and set up proper relationships

### Table Relationship Chain
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: Sequential GraphQL validation errors for missing fields: `datasources ‚Üí branches ‚Üí versions ‚Üí dataschemas`
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: CubeJS expects full relational chain but relationships weren't configured in Hasura
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Set up complete relationship chain with proper foreign key references and array relationships

### Database Migration & Seed Automation - RESOLVED
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: Hasura wasn't running migrations and seeds automatically on Kubernetes startup
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: Migration job only applied migrations and metadata, missing seed data application
‚Ä¢ **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Built custom Docker image with migrations and seeds included
  - Created migration Job for running `hasura migrate apply`, `hasura metadata apply`, and `hasura seed apply`
  - Added proper init container configuration for dependency ordering
  - **Result**: Full database schema with populated demo data automatically applied

## üîß **Configuration & Routing Issues**

### Ingress API Routing
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: All API calls incorrectly routed to frontend client service instead of proper backends
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: Ingress configuration had wrong service targets for API endpoints
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Fixed routing to direct:
  - `/v1/graphql` ‚Üí `synmetrix-hasura:8080` (GraphQL API)
  - `/api` ‚Üí `synmetrix-cubejs:4000` (CubeJS REST API)  
  - `/` ‚Üí `synmetrix-client:80` (Frontend client)

### WebSocket Connection Support
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: Frontend WebSocket connections failing with connection errors
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: NGINX ingress missing WebSocket upgrade headers for Hasura subscriptions
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Added WebSocket support annotations and server snippets to ingress configuration

### Environment Variable Management
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: Individual environment variables scattered across deployments, hard to manage
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: No centralized configuration strategy
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Moved to ConfigMaps and Secrets using `envFrom` for centralized environment management

### Authentication Service Routing
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: `/login` endpoint returning 404 errors, no authentication functionality
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: Missing Hasura Backend Plus service and ingress routes  
‚Ä¢ **Solution**:
  - Added `hasura-plus-service.yaml` for authentication service
  - Updated ingress with `/auth` routes to Hasura Backend Plus

## üèóÔ∏è **Infrastructure Issues**

### Volume Attachment Conflicts  
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: Hasura pods failing with "Multi-Attach error" for persistent volumes
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: ReadWriteOnce volumes can only be attached to one node, rolling updates create conflicts
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Implemented proper deployment strategy and volume management for StatefulSets

### Redis Connectivity Issues - PARTIALLY RESOLVED
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: CubeJS failing with "Redis is disabled" and connection errors
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: External Redis service (`redis-master.data.svc.cluster.local`) not accessible from pods
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Deployed dedicated Redis instance within Synmetrix namespace:
  - Created Redis deployment with persistent storage (2GB PVC)
  - Added Redis service exposing port 6379
  - Updated `REDIS_URL` to `redis://synmetrix-redis:6379`
‚Ä¢ **Status**: Redis deployed successfully, but CubeJS still reports "Redis is disabled" (may need `CUBEJS_REDIS_URL` configuration)

### Container Architecture Improvements
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: Inappropriate Kubernetes resource types for stateful services
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: Using Deployments for services requiring stable storage and network identity
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: 
  - Converted Cubestore from Deployment to StatefulSet for stable persistent storage
  - Added proper cross-platform Docker builds (ARM64 ‚Üí AMD64) for cluster deployment
  - Configured image pull secrets and policies for private registry access

## üìä **Application Logic Issues**

### Empty Database Tables - RESOLVED
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: GraphQL schema available but CubeJS reporting "At least one context should be returned"
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: Database tables existed with proper schema but contained no seed data
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: 
  - Updated migration job to include `hasura-cli seed apply` command
  - Applied demo seed data (`1708465495269_demoSeed.sql`) containing:
    - 2 sample datasources (ClickHouse and PostgreSQL demos)
    - Branches, versions, and dataschemas with complete relational chain
    - Demo user accounts and team structure
  - CubeJS now successfully processes refresh intervals with populated data

### Missing Environment Configuration
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: Services failing due to missing required environment variables
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: Incomplete environment variable configuration in Kubernetes vs Docker Compose
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Added missing configuration variables:
  - `HASURA_WS_ENDPOINT=/v1/graphql` for WebSocket connections
  - `ACTIONS_URL=http://synmetrix-actions:3000` for service communication
  - Various CubeJS and Hasura configuration parameters

### Service Startup Dependencies
‚Ä¢ **Problem**: CubeJS starting before database migrations created required tables
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: No proper dependency ordering between migration job and application services
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: CubeJS schema dependencies resolved through proper table tracking and relationship setup

## üîß **Key Kubernetes Concepts Applied**

### Configuration Management
‚Ä¢ **Kustomize** - Used for environment-specific configuration overlays (staging/production)
‚Ä¢ **ConfigMaps vs Secrets** - Proper separation of sensitive and non-sensitive configuration data
‚Ä¢ **Environment Variable Strategies** - Centralized config using `envFrom` instead of individual `env` entries

### Resource Management  
‚Ä¢ **StatefulSets vs Deployments** - Used StatefulSets for services requiring stable storage (Cubestore, Redis)
‚Ä¢ **Persistent Volume Claims** - Configured with appropriate access modes and storage classes
‚Ä¢ **Resource Limits** - Set CPU and memory limits for all services

### Service Architecture
‚Ä¢ **Jobs** - Used for one-time migration tasks and initialization
‚Ä¢ **Init Containers** - For dependency ordering and pre-startup tasks  
‚Ä¢ **Ingress Routing** - Multi-service architecture with proper path-based routing
‚Ä¢ **Service Discovery** - Internal DNS-based service communication

### Security & Access
‚Ä¢ **Image Pull Secrets** - Private registry access configuration
‚Ä¢ **Service Accounts** - Proper RBAC configuration for pod security
‚Ä¢ **TLS Termination** - Certificate management through cert-manager

## üìö **Lessons Learned**

### Docker Compose ‚Üí Kubernetes Migration
1. **Environment Variables**: Direct translation doesn't work; need proper ConfigMap/Secret strategy
2. **Networking**: Service names change; internal DNS resolution requires different approaches  
3. **Storage**: Volume management more complex; need to consider access modes and node affinity
4. **Dependencies**: Explicit dependency management required through init containers or Jobs

### Database Integration  
1. **Schema Management**: Hasura table tracking is manual unless automated through migrations
2. **Connection Strings**: SSL parameters and service discovery names require careful configuration
3. **Migration Timing**: Database migrations must complete before dependent services start

### Security Considerations
1. **Secret Management**: Never use placeholder values in production configurations
2. **Authentication**: Ensure consistent secrets across all services in distributed architecture
3. **Network Security**: Proper ingress configuration essential for multi-service routing

## üîÑ **Future Improvements**

### Automation Opportunities  
- **GitOps Integration**: Automated deployment through ArgoCD or Flux
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards for observability
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated database and Redis backup procedures

### Production Readiness
