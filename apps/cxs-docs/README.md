# CXS Docs PVC Configuration

This document outlines the changes made to the PVC configuration for the cxs-docs application based on best practices observed in the repository.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to the `cxs-docs-pvc.yaml` file:

1. Added labels to the metadata section:
   - `app: cxs-docs` - Identifies the application this PVC belongs to
   - `service: cxs-docs-pvc` - Identifies the specific service/resource
   - `tier: web` - Matches the tier label used in the deployment

2. Maintained the absence of an explicit `storageClassName` to use the default storage class in the cluster.

## Best Practices Observed

After examining multiple PVC configurations in the repository, the following best practices were identified:

1. **No Explicit Storage Class**: None of the PVCs in the repository specify a `storageClassName`, allowing the cluster to use its default storage class. This makes the PVC more flexible across different Kubernetes environments.

2. **Access Modes**: Most PVCs use the `ReadWriteOnce` access mode, which allows the volume to be mounted as read-write by a single node. This is appropriate for most applications, including cxs-docs.

3. **Consistent Naming**: All PVCs follow a consistent naming pattern, typically including the application name and "-pvc" suffix (e.g., `cxs-docs-pvc`).

4. **Labeling**: Many PVCs include labels that identify the application and service they belong to, which helps with organization, filtering, and management.

5. **Storage Sizing**: Storage requests vary based on the needs of the application, ranging from 1Gi to 16Gi in the examples examined.

## Compatibility with Deployment

The cxs-docs deployment correctly references the PVC in the volumes section:

```yaml
volumes:
- name: docs-data
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: cxs-docs-pvc
```

The deployment includes a HorizontalPodAutoscaler that allows scaling between 1 and 3 replicas. Since the PVC uses the `ReadWriteOnce` access mode, each pod will get its own copy of the PVC when scaling.

## Conclusion

The updated PVC configuration follows the best practices observed in the repository and is compatible with the deployment. The changes made enhance the organization and management of the PVC resource while maintaining flexibility across different Kubernetes environments.
