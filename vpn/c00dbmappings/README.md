# c00dbmappings

## Purpose
[Please fill in a brief description of what c00dbmappings are used for. The name suggests they might be related to database mappings, possibly for an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), data source connections, or specific data transformation rules, potentially related to S3 or other object storage as hinted in the main README.]

## Configuration
- Configuration is managed via Kustomize overlays, with environment-specific settings in the `overlays/` directory (e.g., `overlays/production/`).
- Secrets are managed in Rancher and injected at deployment time. Refer to the main project `README.md` for more details on secret management.

## Deployment
Deployed and managed via Fleet, as specified in `fleet.yaml`. The actual resources are defined within the Kustomize overlays.

## Backup and Restore
[Details on backup and restore procedures need to be added.]

## Key Files
- `fleet.yaml`: Fleet configuration for deployment.
- `overlays/`: Directory containing Kustomize overlays for different environments.
